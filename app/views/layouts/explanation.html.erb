Understanding our model.
1/ Draw the schema
We have 3 models, where they are joined by the doses
so we have to create (in drawing the schema) an ingredient_id and cocktail_id, we join these
foreign keys from the cocktail & ingredient tables to the doses table.
2/ We create our models. We create the ingredient and cocktail model first, then we create
the doses model, with 2 different references. cocktail:references and ingredient:references.
3/ We db:migrate and then check our schema to see it is working.
